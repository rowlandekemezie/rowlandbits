### The problem

Your development team delivers lots of changes to client facing application. For the most part, developers don't know when they've broken anything on the UI. You ship UI changes with less confidence not knowing if something broke. Whereas there are decent code review, manual QA and test coverage, they are still not enough to catch all UI bugs. One option is to go all out to engage more manual QA personnel. Alternatively, find a scalable way of integrating automated visual reviews with immediate feedback cycle to improve the whole process and ship with confidence.

### There're a few reasons for visual reviews:

- Manual QA is not scalable
- Visual regression testing is a life saver
- Automated feedback is a great gain
- Cross browser compatibility issues still live

### Why Percy

I think [percy](https://percy.io/) does a great job on the above issues. It integrates with your existing CI workflow, highlights visual diffs across browsers, screens and snapshots. The icing on the cake is the ability to review and approve these changes. Basically, Percy combines visual testings and review platform in one which is pretty cool.

> As, at the time of this writing, Percy is free for up to 5k snapshots monthly.

#### Let's walk through how to use Percy

I'd be integrating this to the [repository](https://github.com/rowlandekemezie/rowlandekemezie.com) that powers my personal website. It's made with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

So, let's first clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rowlandekemezie/rowlandekemezie.com.git
```

### Run Percy locally

You can configure percy-cli for testing locally

```bash
$ gem install percy-cli
```

Before we proceed, we'll need a _PERCY_TOKEN_ which is _write-only_ API key that only has access to create builds, snapshots, and upload resources to this project. So, signup on [percy](https://percy.io) with your GitHub account.

Next, create an organization name, confirmation email and click _Start new project_.

![Create org Percy](./images/percy-create-org.png)

Next up is to add a project to your organization. Probably, a good idea to use the repository name.

![Create project Percy](./images/percy-create-project.png)

All is set. Now, you have your _PERCY_TOKEN_ which will be used for running the test locally and on CI.

![Percy token](./images/percy-token.png)

Let's get back to the terminal to test it out locally with the token

![Percy-local-snapshot](./images/percy-local-snapshot.png)

> Ensure you run _yarn build_ first.

Click on the link generated below to review it on Percy platform.

![percy-snapshot](./images/local-snapshot-build.png)

> The left column is blank because there's no snapshot to compare against yet.

### Integrate Percy with your CI workflow

We'll love to integrate percy to our CI workflow. It should run on every commit.

Let's use CircleCI for this. However, it works just fine with every other supported [CI platform](https://docs.percy.io/docs/ci-setup).

First, let's set up the project on CircleCI. login/signup to CircleCI with your GitHub account.

Click on _ADD PROJECTS_ on the sidebar and then click on _Set Up Project_ button for the project of choice.

![CI setup workflow](./images/ci-setup-workflow.png)

We'll keep the default setting on the next page(Linux and Node) and follow other instructions.

Next up, create _.circleci/config.yml_ in the root directory and populate with

```bash

version: 2

defaults: &defaults
  docker:
    - image: circleci/node:10.15.1
  working_directory: ~/repo

jobs:
  # install: ...

  # lint: ...

  visual:
    - image: circleci/ruby:2.6.2-node-browsers
    working_directory: ~/repo

    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: install dependencies
          command: |
            yarn install
            gem install percy-cli
      - run:
          name: Run visual test
          command: |
            yarn build
            percy snapshot public

workflows:
  version: 2
  # test: ...
  visual-test:
      jobs:
        - visual
```

> I commented out some of the jobs already existing in the project to help us focus on the scope of this article. When you're done testing, feel free to uncomment them 👌.

Commit and push your code to master. Head over to CircleCI click _Start building_. Hopefully, this is successful 👍

The build succeeds but because _PERCY_TOKEN_ was not provided, the snapshots won't be pushed to percy.io for our review.

![Percy token required](./images/percy-authentication.png)

Let's fix it...

The same way we ran Percy locally with the _PERCY_TOKEN_, we'll add it to the environment variables. So, click on the settings Icon

![Setting icon](./images/setting-icon.png)

Click on _Environment variables_ in the sidebar to add your token

![Environment Variable Modal](./images/env-variable-modal.png).

Commit your changes and push to master again.

Now, we can head to percy.io to see the snapshots created by the build.

![circle ci build](./images/circle-ci-build.png)

> Percy automatically detects that there's no change hence, "All changes approved automatically on this branch".

### Link up Percy to your repository

The final part of this setup is to link Percy to our repository to get immediate feedback after each build.

In the project setting on Percy, click on _install an integration_ and choose _GitHub_.
![Link percy to repo](./images/link-to-repository.png)

Here you go...
Select the repository you want to install Percy and click _install_.

![Install percy github](./images/install-percy-github.png)

With the source code integration enabled, we can manage our pull request statuses, notifying us when visual changes are detected. It also gives a nice interface to approve those changes with the record of who approved the pull request.

Now you can select the repository to link to each project
![Select project](./images/select-repository.png)

### End to end test

Now, let's test everything together. Let's create a test branch and increase the _font-size_ of the content's title in _/components/Post/Content/Content.module.scss_. Commit the change and create a pull request.

```css
......

.content {

  &__title {
    font-size: $typographic-base-font-size * 4; // highlight-line
    max-width: $layout-post-width;
    ......
    ......
  }
```

This is a fantastic part of it. There are a whopping 15 visual changes introduced by the font-size change.

![visual changes](./images/visual-changes.png)

You can click on details to take us straight to Percy to compare the changes
![visual changes on percy](./images/percy-visual-changes.png)

> The red font-colour on the right column only show the area of the UI affected by the change(s). You can click on it to see the actual changes.

We can approve the changes by clicking _Approve all_ and boom all checks passed ✅

![check passed](./images/check-passed.png)

Percy gives you and your team the power to review and approve UI changes with confidence. You can build toolings around the capabilities it provides.
