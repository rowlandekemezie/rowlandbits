![Code review]()

Quality software development requires efficient process for code reviews. Tech teams spend about ~15% of their time doing code review and handling the resultant effect. Whereas this is a great habit for tech team not everything fall under the category of code reviews. 

Over the 1 year I've seen myself spend bulk of my time reviewing code considering my position and numerous customers we're working with. I've learnt quick a few lesson because ~20% of my time is spent on code reviews and resolving it's resultant effects.

Without the write mentality, code reviews can kill creativity and make problem solving especially junior developers tailoring their code just to get approval from the reviewer.

## How important is code review?
Lot's of materials our there about the benefits of code review. I'd try to summarize few of them from my personal experience before I address the main focus of this article.

- Simplicity and maintainability
Is our of the core goals of code review. The value of simple code can not be over emphasized.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good code is simple. Code reviews are a great way to train teams to write simple code. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &quot;this is hard to understand&quot;.</p>&mdash; Eric Elliott (@_ericelliott) <a href="https://twitter.com/_ericelliott/status/1117217162844884992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

- Knowlege sharing
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Code reviews are best for bug prevention, not bug catching. The magic comes from the knowledge sharing.</p>&mdash; Eric Elliott (@_ericelliott) <a href="https://twitter.com/_ericelliott/status/1113229761453727744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When a team regularly responds to code reviews with ‚ÄúLooks good to me‚Äù, I get concerned.<br><br>A code review with no questions, comments, issues, or suggestions for improvement should be rare, not the norm.</p>&mdash; Cory House üè† (@housecor) <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1113192633785040903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2019</a></blockquote>

## what code reviewers are not for
I see myself making lots of comments on the same thing across multiple projects and it dawn on me that I'm doing something wrong. Yes, really wrong.
- Not for bug catching but for prevention


### why code reviews are great
Code reviews are great with tons of benefits but time wasted on some issues could have been resolved upfront with better process.

-writing technical specification


‚Ää-‚ÄäWhat is a technical specification


-Setting up prettier(formatter)


-Setting up linting


-Pre-commit hooks

-Automated visual testing



-Maintain agreed team's guidelines
Guideline is subjective and reflects the stage a team is in its development.

Cons of code reviews
Back and forth
Code tailored to get approval from the reviewer(Removes creativity and makes problem-solving a bit boring)
